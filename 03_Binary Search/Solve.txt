    Initial Step: Start by guessing 500.
        If the hint is "Higher," the target number is between 501 and 1000.
        If "Lower," it’s between 1 and 499.

    Second Guess:
        If the first guess was "Higher," guess 750.
        If "Lower," guess 250.

    Third Guess:
        Based on previous feedback, continue halving the range.
        For example, if the range is 501–750, guess 625. If it's 1–250, guess 125.

    Continue Halving:
        Repeat this process, always guessing the midpoint of the current range.
        This binary search approach ensures you find the target number within 10 guesses.

    Winning Condition:
        Once you guess the correct number, the script will automatically connect to the CTF server to retrieve the flag.

Example Sequence (if the target is 700):

    Guess 500 → "Higher"
    Guess 750 → "Lower"
    Guess 625 → "Higher"
    Guess 687 → "Higher"
    Guess 719 → "Lower"
    Guess 703 → "Lower"
    Guess 695 → "Higher"
    Guess 699 → "Higher"
    Guess 700 → "Correct!"

Using this strategy maximizes efficiency and ensures a quick win.
